# Add-On for Terminal Multiplexer (ATMUX)
Could also be that that is some kind of tmux wrapper. Don't know how to classify it.
I pretty much just want to add stuff to tmux, which absence kind of annoys me :)

### So what have I added
If it will actually work (haven't tested it yet), then I have added:

* Serialization of tmux sessions
* Tracker for actually attached sessions

Thats it.

Don't know, if I will get it to run I will update this README again.
Till then, I will continue blindly writing code for atmux.
